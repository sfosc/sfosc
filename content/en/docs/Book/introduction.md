  Introduction

The free and open source community is in a deeper state of introspection than
at any time in its history. We are thinking through and having conversations
about "sustainable business models" and the rise of "as a service" behemoths in
AWS, Google and Microsoft. We are asking ourselves if ethics have a place in
our governance and licensing models. We are questioning the fundamental values
and ideas of the movement itself.

The term “Open Source” was first adopted in 1997. At the time, it was common
practice for software to be distributed in binary/compiled form with
restrictive licensing and no access to the source code. Meanwhile, for over a
decade, liberal licenses had been used for software developed at universities
for fostering collaboration. The underlying philosophy behind these licenses
was to foster collaborative communities where a single institution can not
limit, or impose restrictions, on the collaboration. The late 1990s and early
2000s saw a significant increase in the adoption of this philosophy for
software development, and a corresponding increase in licensing of software
under such liberal licenses.

Since then, Open Source has become the dominant software development model
around the world. Today, you can actively participate in Open Source without
any background at all in its philosophy. Open Source is in the water for the
new generation of software developers.

Along with the rise in open source development, the number of open source
companies has also skyrocketed. Consulting companies, service providers,
managed services, and venture-backed startups abound. This influx of capital
into the production of open source software fuels our growth. Open Source is
eating the world not only because the Bazaar is better for development. It is
good business.

This business often happens as direct product revenue--selling open source
products to customers. More frequently, it happens when open source software is
one component enabling a business to generate revenue. This massive influx of
capital, on both sides of the equation, raises interesting questions. Can open
source software at this scale exist without businesses funding it? Are we
comfortable with how it is used? Where does the community begin and end? Who
can take part in the community, how, and why? Who can profit from the software,
and how?

35 years have passed since Richard Stallman introduced us to the idea of Free
Software. 20 years since the dawn of the Open Source era at Netscape. Why are
we building open source software in the first place? What is it good for? Who
does it serve? How do we ensure that, no matter what happens, or who
participates in our community, that the work we do serves us all? It is time to
reassess our fundamental principles.

This is my attempt to start that conversation in earnest. I believe the path
forward requires a restatement of our fundamental principles and goals. It
leads to a new, intentional, sustainable model for designing our open source
communities. It embraces the existence of capital in the system. It reconciles
the existence of open source projects with open source products. It is
inclusive of everyone who wants to participate.

The result is the creation of the _Sustainable Free and Open Source Community_
(SFOSC) project. There are three parts. The first is the "Principles" - a list
of requirements for a sustainable free and open source community. The second is
a set of "Community Social Contracts", the number of which should grow over
time. These are explicit social contracts that all participants can agree to
and understand. Think of it like Creative Commons, but for community
agreements. This document is the last piece - it is the explanation of how
I arrived at the beginning of this journey. My hope is that it provides
a baseline of knowledge for future collaboration, in the open, as a community.
Together, we will evolve the principles, publish many social contracts, and can
talk about the trade-offs we make in choosing one contract over the other. 

We'll begin with a statement of my own background and motivations. I want my
own biases to be as clear as possible, so they can be challenged as we build on
these ideas together. The rest is an explanation of the model and analysis
I used to arrive at the "Principles". I look forward to refining these
principles with you, and using them to develop clear social contracts. I'm
excited to explore how we can build sustainable communities together.
