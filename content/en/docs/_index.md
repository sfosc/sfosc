Welcome to the SFOSC Documentation pages
{{% /pageinfo %}}

Welcome! This is a place dedicated to the discussion, creation, and evolution
of Sustainable Free and Open Source Communities. We are organized around the
development of a set of shared [principles](/docs/principles/) that we
believe lead to healthy, sustainable open source communities.

Our conception of community is an expansive one – it covers developers, users,
evangelists, venture capitalists – anyone who believes that software is better
when it is built in a community, and that communities are formed because of
a shared understanding between people.

In addition to the [principles](/docs/principles/), we intend to publish
a set of ready to use [social contracts](/docs/social-contracts/). These
social contracts can be adopted by free and open source software projects, and
go in to detail the expectations of the community around: leadership,
contribution, codes of conduct, monetary investment, and more. We're still
working on those. :)

If you're considering starting an open source project, and you intend to start
a business around it, you might be interested in our [explanation of the
various open source business models](/docs/business-models/). This
includes why some create more sustainable communities than others.

Finally, you might [want to read the book](/docs/books/) on the
thought process and research that went in to the creation of SFOSC. It provides
a detailed background of the initial motivations behind the community, and the
framework by which the principles were created.
