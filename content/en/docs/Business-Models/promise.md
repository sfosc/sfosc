The Promise model is for software that is open sourced once certain conditions are met.

### Who Uses it?

* [Sushi](https://github.com/sponsorware/docs)
  * Open for sponsors
  * Open for all once critical mass of sponsors is reached

### When should it be used?

When the original author desires the buildup of a critical mass, monetary or otherwise,
that would would likely be impossible if the project was open sourced from the start.

### What kind of monetization is possible?

The promise includes the type of business model under which the software will be released.
The monetization possibilities before open sourcing depend on the conditions in the promise.
The monetization possibilities after open sourcing depend on the business model promised.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

Just like with monetization possibilities, this depends on the promise.
