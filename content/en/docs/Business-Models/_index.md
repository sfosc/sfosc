These pages include business models for open source.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

This section contains an overview of the various open source business models, with
examples of companies that use them. We evaluate each in the context of wether it
can be used to build a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community, according to
the [Principles](/docs/principles/).

While each is taken separately, a given community might have multiple models present
inside of it - or even a given company may have multiple models present at the 
same time.
