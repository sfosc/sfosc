The Free Software Product model has 100% of the software covered by an open
source license, but distributes the software as a complete, supported product
under a proprietary license.

Free Software Product companies use their trademark rights, along with the license
of the software itself, to create proprietary derivatives. If there is a 100%
open source distribution, it uses different trademarks and naming conventions, and
receives little or no direct support for users from the upstream.

A cornerstone of this model is that the company produces little or no proprietary
software. It allows the community to collaborate and makes it harder for proprietary
derivatives to thrive.

### Who Uses It

### When should it be used?

When a single company provides the bulk of the effort to create and sustain
the project, and has a clear target market for the product (typically the large
enterprise).

### What kind of monetization is possible?

Any kind of monetization is possible on the product. Because it is being distributed
under proprietary terms, the options for monetization are unlimited. For those who
might wish to create downstream versions of the project, they too are free to monetize
as they see fit.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

Yes. By keeping 100% of the software open source, and not producing any proprietary
features, the community is free to collaborate with the upstream. A 100% free downstream
distribution can be created, and distributed - optionally with complete monetization.
Note that there might be an incentive for Free Software Product companies to
limit access to key documentation to support contract holders.
