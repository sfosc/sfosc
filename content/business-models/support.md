The Support model is one where the software is available under an open source license,
but in order to have the company available to answer questions, assist in implementation,
etc., you must purchase a support contract.

[This model is often confused for the Free Software Product model]({{% ref "business-models/free-software-product" %}}).

### Who Uses it?

* XenSource (very early on - moved to loose open core over time)
* All sorts of companies for a minute :)

### When should it be used?

This is typically an early way to bring in revenue for an open source project. If/when
the company or project needs to scale, it tends to transition into another model.

### What kinds of monetization is possible?

Any, essentially.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

Yes.
