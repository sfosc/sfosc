Dual Licensing is a model where the software is released under an open source
license, almost always a [copyleft
license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft), but has a single entity with
full control of the software's copyright. This enables the company to re-license the
software as they see fit - either to sell it under a non-copyleft license, to
run it as a service, or to sell propreitary versions, while restricting the rights of others to do the same.

### When should it be used?

A tool used primarily by venture backed startups, with a single company in
control of the asset. The goal here is that the software is useful to a wide market
with the copyleft terms attached, but for certain segments of the market, or to
create your own proprietary derivative, you retain the rights to remove the copyleft.

### What kind of monetization is possible?

Depending on the type of copyleft license, it ranges from simply selling identical
software without copyleft terms (for embedding, as an example), to being
allowed to run the software as a service, to being allowed to build fully
proprietary distributions with enhanced functionality.

In any case, it is used to create a functional monopoly on monetization for the company.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

No. It trades the [fundamental liberties in the core commitment]({{% ref "principles" %}}) in exchange for revenue.
