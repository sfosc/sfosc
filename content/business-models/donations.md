Not really a "business model", but lets go with it anyway. The donations model is when 
the project sets up a system of donations, which are used to sustain the project.

### Who uses it?

* [Vim](https://www.vim.org)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

### When should it be used?

When the project is core infrastructure, primarily run by volunteers, or simply to
do good in the world.

### What kind of monetization is possible?

Anything that is valid under the license. In this model, though, sponsorship and
individuals alike are solicited to cover the infrastructure and development costs
for the project.

[Take a look at the Webpack Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/webpack) for a
great example of the donation model in action.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

Yes.
