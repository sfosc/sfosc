Loose Open Core is a model where the software has its primary functionality
covered under an open source license (the "core"), with proprietary software 
wrapped around it. This model encourages widespread distribution of the core
software, and tries to ensure that enough value exists in the proprietary
software around it to convince their target market to make a purchase.

### When should it be used?

This is model that is frequently used by venture backed startups, where a single
company puts in the bulk of the engineering and product resources. If the core
project is successful, it leads to a large funnel of users that can then be
sold the proprietary software.

If the core of the software has broad applicability to a wide market, and you
can envision a proprietary product targeted at some segement of the market, this
model can work well.

### What kind of monetization is possible?

These communities are often monetized from the beginning, or at least are intended
to be. The difficulty with this model is that it can be hard to determine where the
right line is for a given feature - does it belong to the proprietary software, or
the open core? 

Typically, there is a single company that monetizes the core software.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

Maybe. If we treat the core software as essentially a free software island with a
single downstream derivative, then yes, assuming others are allowed to also build
proprietary software around the core. 

However, this is often murky - since the company's strategy depends on convincing
a segment of the population that they must purchase the proprietary software, it
will be easy for the company to turn to other models, which may mean it is no
longer sustainable by the community.
