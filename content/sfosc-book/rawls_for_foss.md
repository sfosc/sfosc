To begin, we have to decide what the primary goods are. What is the thing we
want, whatsoever else we might want. We can take for granted Rawls list
(freedom of expression, etc), since we are scoping things down to our
sustainable open source community. In its place, a reasonable statement of the
primary good we want is:

> We want the software to exist, to solve our problem, to continue to improve,
> and to be available for our use.

Since our primary good is software, it has the unique property of being
infinite in amount. If we want more of it, we can simply... create more of it.
This definition ensures we will not trade away our ability to be sustainable.

Now we need to apply the equal liberty principle. What are the rights we won't
trade?

It turns out that the [Four Freedoms set forth by Richard
Stallman](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) (RMS) are a perfect
fit here. (I suspect not by accident - I put the odds that RMS didn't read
Rawls in 1983 at slim to none.) They are:

* The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
* The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your
  computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is
  a precondition for this.
* The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
* The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom
  3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from
  your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.

By adopting the four freedoms as our foundational rights, we guarantee our
community's basic liberty. Regardless of our position in the community, we will
always have access to our primary good. Anything less than the four freedoms
and we could easily be in a position where we are locked out of the community.
Where our basic desire goes unfulfilled. By agreeing to never trade away our
four freedoms, we fulfill the equal liberty principle.

This implies that, to be sustainable open source community:

* The software must be released under a Free and Open Source license.

This could be a 'copyleft' license like the GNU General Public License (GPL),
or a 'non-copyleft' license such as the Apache License. The specific license
doesn't matter - only that it upholds the four freedoms.

This is, of course, not quite enough. We want more than just basic liberty in
our lives - the “whatsoever else we might want” part of Rawls conception of the
good. We want prestige, we want influence, we want money, we want friendship
- the list is long. Simply having the software isn’t worth much if we can’t
ensure a long life together as a community. It may give us liberty, but it
won’t give us fraternity.

Once we start injecting the other things we want into our community, we are
going to cause inequality. We need to ensure that those inequalities meet fair
equality of opportunity and the difference principle. To do that, we need to
have a better understanding of what the positions are we might occupy in our
community. What are the different outcomes of the dice roll that determines our
fate?

* *Founders*: the original authors of the software. They begin with 100% of the
  goods in our community. (If it wasn’t for their initial decision to create
  a community in the first place, there would be no community.)
* *Developers*: people with the technical ability and desire to improve the
  software; for their own benefit, the benefit of their employer, the desire
  to be active in the community or a combination of these.
* *Contributors*: those who engage in the work of making the software better but
  not by writing code. They might file bug reports, compile release notes,
  write documentation, answer questions, etc.
* *Champions*: people who promote the benefits of the software and benefit by
  gaining visibility and authority.
* *Non-Commercial Users*: folks who use the software to solve their own
  problems. Distinct in that they are not solving the problem of how to
  generate wealth with the software.
* *Commercial Users*: users of the software who are solving problems related to
  generating wealth. Distinct in that they are not generating wealth from the
  software directly.
* *Software Businesses*: entities that sell a build of the software, and
  provide support for its use.
* *As-A-Service Businesses*: distinct from software businesses, in that they
  provide the software as a service, over a network.
* *Managed Service Businesses*: similar to As-A-Service Businesses, but
  provide the software as a service at a location of the consumer's choice.
  Manage the lifecycle of the software on behalf of the consumer.
* *Consulting Businesses*: sell implementation and strategic consulting around
  the software.
* *Venture Capitalists*: people that provide funding of businesses in return
  for a stake in the business. Have the express desire that the business grows
  significantly in value.

This conception of community is an expansive one - it includes not only
software developers, but anyone who has a stake in our community. How can we
exclude the contributors who don't write software? The venture capitalists who
bring massive amounts of money to the table? All these are different aspects of
the work involved in supporting the creation, evolution, use and extension of
the software. We have to include them all, and as we discover new ones, include
them as well.  If we do not, we can't be sure we're evaluating our rules
against a realistic field.
