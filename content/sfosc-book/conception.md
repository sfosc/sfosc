If we are to re-align the incentives, we have to start from the top, and that
means definitions. When I say “Sustainable Open Source Community”, I mean the
following:

> A unified body of individuals, scattered throughout a larger society, who work
> in support of the creation, evolution, use, and extension of free and open
> source software; while ensuring its longevity through meeting the needs of the
> present without compromising the ability of the community of the future to
> meet its own needs.

This definition comes from a combination of my own brain, the Merriam-Webster
dictionary definition of community, and the broader understanding of
sustainable economic development.

When I say “free and open source software”, I mean it in the terms defined by
the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
and the [Open Source Initiative's Open Source
Definition](https://opensource.org/osd). While all Free Software is Open Source
software, the inverse is not true. I use Open Source as the short form because
it is the super-set of software communities that potentially fit my definition.

My definition precludes "user" communities from being sustainable. An example
here is the "Excel" community - while I’m sure one exists, it’s not a community
in the sense that I mean it. The community itself isn't involved in the
creation and evolution of the software. At best, they can contribute to its
extension. If Microsoft stops producing Excel, what can the community do? They
have no mechanism to ensure its longevity. The Excel community is sustainable
only so long as it is profitable to Microsoft. It's a sustainable software
business, but not a sustainable community.

This points to the most unique property of a sustainable open source community:
longevity. It must be able to produce the software for as long as it is of
benefit to the community. As long as we ignore the cost of resources required to
run the hardware, the software itself is an infinite resource. We don't have the
same struggle that we would have with, say, sustainable water usage. The
software can continue to evolve and be used as long as it is needed.

Participants in a sustainable open source community gain many benefits. They
obviously gain the software itself, as a user. They gain the ability to
influence the direction of the software. They may gain reputation and
visibility. Monetary benefits might flow to them, either through employment or
donations. The list encompasses all the benefits of being in a community, plus
the software itself.

Our goal is the creation of a community who can sustain the software, and
provide benefits to its members, both now and in the future. To do that, the
community must create a model where the majority of the value it creates flows
to its benefit. Take the example of Chef being Open Core from above. Any value
created on the proprietary side of the line is not available to the broader
community. While the software itself is an infinite resource, we've created
a non-infinite downstream pool - we reserved some benefit for a subset of the
community, my paying customers. As a result, we created a user community
- which, while it may be sustainable as a software business, is not sustainable
as a community resource.
