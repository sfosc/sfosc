# Sustainable Free and Open Source Community

Welcome! This is a place dedicated to the discussion, creation, and evolution
of Sustainable Free and Open Source Communities. We are organized around the
development of a set of shared [principles]({{%ref "principles" %}}) that we
believe lead to healthy, sustainable open source communities.

Our conception of community is an expansive one - it covers developers, users,
evangelists, venture capitalists - anyone who believes that software is better
when it is built in a community, and that communities are formed because of
a shared understanding between people.

In addition to the [principles]({{% ref "principles" %}}), we intend to publish
a set of ready to use [social contracts]({{% ref "social-contracts" %}}). These
social contracts can be adopted by free and open source software projects, and
go in to detail the expectations of the community around: leadership,
contribution, codes of conduct, monetary investment, and more. We're still
working on those. :)

If you're considering starting an open source project, and you intend to start
a business around it, you might be interested in our [explanation of the
various open source business models]({{% ref "business-models" %}}). This
includes why some create more sustainable communities than others.

Finally, you might [want to read the book]({{% ref "sfosc-book" %}}) on the
thought process and research that went in to the creation of SFOSC. It provides
a detailed background of the initial motivations behind the community, and the
framework by which the principles were created.
 
## Join us

We would love to have you help us evolve the principles, write new social contracts, and further explore what it means to create sustainable free and open source communities. There are a couple ways to get started:

  * Send us a [pull request for this website](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc)!
  * Start a conversation by [filing an issue](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/issues)

Is itself a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community, using the [Donation Social Contract]({{% ref "social-contracts/donation.md" %}}). The current leader is <a href="mailto:adam@stalecoffee.org">Adam Jacob</a>, but we'll be having our first election soon.
